This is the supplementary material for arXiv preprint  "A generalization of a U-statistics-based MCAR Test: Utilizing Partially Observed Variables" that includes the code that calculates the test statistics that were used, i.e. corresponding p-values, as well as the Excel file(s) that include additional size and power simulations. Some of those will be added later, but no old ones will be removed. Their names include the date when simulations were executed and uploaded.
